techne is the design guideline and component library for modern, mobile-first, user-centric experience design on YaaS that gives UX professionals the freedom and creativity to implement experiences from design to deployment FAST

techne design patterns serve consumers and business users equally. It enables best practice storefront and other digital touchpoint experiences as well as what we like to call the “consumerization of business user tooling,” which is an ethos that envisions any digital experience, regardless of whether it is buying a shirt as a consumer or marketing that shirt as a business user, will provide the same highly engaged, visual, efficient and fun experience.
