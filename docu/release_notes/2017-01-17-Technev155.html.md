### Minor Improvements
* The Starter Page "[Details 1](https://techne.yaas.io/starterpages/details-1.html)" now reflect changes for displaying and updating avatar images.
* The former **Localization Editor** is now renamed to the more generic **Multi Tab Editor**. You can use the Multi Tab Editor to enter information with multiple dimensions, such as prices and currencies in different regions.
* The header style is now the same for the **Tree** and **Table** patterns.
* The **Tree** pattern now highlights any row when you hover over it with your cursor.
