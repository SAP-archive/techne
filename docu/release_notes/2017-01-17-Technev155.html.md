### Minor Improvements
* The Starter Page "[Details 1](https://techne.yaas.io/starterpages/details-1.html)" has been updated to reflect the changes on how to display and update Avatar images.
* "Localized Editor" has been renamed to a more generic name: "Multi Tab Editor". It can be used also for input information with multiple dimentions like: price in different regions, currencies, etc.
* The header style of "Tree" and "Table" are now the same.
* The "Tree" pattern now highlight the row when the cursor hovers it.
