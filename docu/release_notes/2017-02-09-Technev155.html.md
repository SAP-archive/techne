### Multi-tab Editor 
The former **Localization Editor** is now renamed to the more generic **Multi-Tab Editor**. You can use the Multi-Tab Editor to collect information with multiple dimensions, such as prices on different currencies, data in different regions, etc.

### Minor Improvements
* The Starter Page "[Details 1](https://techne.yaas.io/starterpages/details-1.html)" now reflect changes for displaying and updating avatar images.
* The header style is now the same for the **Tree** and **Table patterns**.
* The **Tree pattern** now highlights any row when you hover over it with your cursor. 
* Our [Tone and voice guidelines](https://techne.yaas.io/Guidelines.html#guidelines-tone-voice) have been updated.
* The **Help bubbles pattern** has been improved, now it displays on top of other elements on the page.
* The padding of **Static Form Elements** has beem improved to provide a more compact look.
* The references to our CSS **Icon-Font** file have now a dynamic **hash** to pevent caching issues.
* The **Cards pattern** has been updated to display a nicer shadow effect and make it less "bumpy" when interacting with the cards.

### Deprecations
* The now old **Localization Editor** is now deprecated. This component CSS classes are still active but only for the next 2 releases. Use the new **Multi-tab Editor** from now on.
