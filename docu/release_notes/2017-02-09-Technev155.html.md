### Multi-tab Editor 
The former **Localization Editor** is now renamed to the more generic **Multi-Tab Editor**. You can use the Multi-Tab Editor to collect information with multiple dimensions, such as prices on different currencies and data in different regions.

### Minor improvements
* The Starter Page [Details 1](https://techne.yaas.io/starterpages/details-1.html) now reflects changes for displaying and updating avatar images.
* The header style is now the same for the **Tree** and **Table patterns**.
* The **Tree pattern** now highlights any row when you hover over it with your cursor. 
* The [Tone and voice guidelines](https://techne.yaas.io/Guidelines.html#guidelines-tone-voice) are updated.
* The **Help bubbles pattern** is improved and now appears on top of other elements on the page.
* The padding of the **Static Form Elements** is improved to provide a more compact look.
* The references to the CSS **Icon-Font** file now have a dynamic **hash** to prevent caching issues.
* The **Cards pattern** is updated to display a nicer shadow effect, and looks less "bumpy" when interacting with the cards.

### Deprecated Localization Editor
* The **Localization Editor** is now deprecated. This component's CSS classes are still active but only for the next two releases. Use the new **Multi-tab Editor** from now on.
