# 2.0

Techne 2.0 is a design system and pattern library package. This project packages the library for `npm` and `bower` and generates the documentation as a static website.

We rely on several core technologies.

* [Node](https://nodejs.org/) (minimum v6.4)
* Gulp
* Bower
* Sass
* Nunjucks

## First
In addition to Node, you must have Gulp and Bower installed globally:

`npm install -g gulp bower`


## Up and running
Install dev dependencies

`npm install`

## Serve it locally
The documentation website is served from the `www` directory.

`npm start`

Start in debug mode
`npm start -- --debug`
__This serves `debug.scss` instead of `all.scss` so that borders, visibility, etc. can be added to assist development with no fear of accidental inclusion.__


## Build production

`gulp docs-build --production`

The documentation website is built to the `www` directory as above. Compiled CSS is copied to `www/public/css` to create a stand-alone static website. This also builds the full distribution package.
