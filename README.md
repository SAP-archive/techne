# The project
Techne 2.0 is a design system and pattern library package. This project packages the library for `npm` and generates the documentation as a static website.

We rely on several core technologies.

* [Node](https://nodejs.org/) (minimum v6.4)
* [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/)
* Sass
* Nunjucks
* Ruby
* Bundle
* Jekyll

## Install Gulp
In addition to Node, you must have Gulp installed globally:

`npm install -g gulp`

## Install Gems
The following gems needs to be installed for the documentation site generation

`gem install ruby bundle jekyll`

## Install Bundle dependencies

`bundle install`

## Install dev dependencies

`npm install`

## Serve it locally
The documentation website is served from the `docs/_site` directory which is generated by Jekyll. To generate and lunch the documentation site, simply execute the gulp command in terminal at the root of project directory.

`gulp`

## Troubleshooting
Please refer to the [Troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/SAP/techne/wiki/Troubleshooting-&-Known-Issues) if you are having issues with the setup.
