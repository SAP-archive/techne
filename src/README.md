# Code
This directory holds the source code for Techne and should include everything needed to generate `bower` and `node` packages.

As a general rule, nothing should be built or compiled into `src`, with two notable exceptions:

1. Icons CSS and associated fonts into `__`
2. Bower components into `vendor`

- This directory should be packaged.
- Output CSS and dependencies to `dist`

## Outputs
- CSS
- JS
- fonts

## Coding Standards
- Use 4 spaces for indentation
